# Social-Network-API

Backend Social application API

## Description

This is a noSQL database that uses MongoDB to make API endpoints. This database is designed to make an API for a social media platform showing knowledge in how to build a backend system using noSQL. During this I learned how to interact with the database to get information from users, a users thoughts, friends reactions and their friends thoughts.
